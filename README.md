# Template driven forms

## The Repo

This repo is created for the forms section of the Udemy Angular course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.  
This part of the course is split up in 2 secionts: Template Driven forms and Reactive forms. I have decided to add everything together in this 1 repository under different components. 


The goal of this repo is the following:
1. Learn about Template driven forms
2. Practice with Template driven forms
3. Learn about Reactive forms
4. Practice with Reactive forms

## Challenges

The syntax for html forms will always be html. Angular provides some tools on top of this to make things easier. 

The biggest challenge is validation on the form. I'm still getting used to working with references, which are very helpful when working with validation. 

Custom validation, especially async, has been the biggest challenge of this subject. Although I'm familiar with async, Typescript requires very thorough syntax which is new for me. Defining the different outcomes of a function and nesting the different outcomes of a promise makes it looks complicated very quick.  

Apart from that, everything seems to be fairly straight to the point. 

## Things I learned

* The difference between Template Driven forms and Reactive forms
* Angulars way of submitting forms
* Angular pre-built directives for validation
* Building custom validators
* Accessing form data
* Working with form/field status
* Angulars way of defining different statusses
