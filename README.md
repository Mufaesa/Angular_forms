# Template driven forms

## The Repo

This repo is created for the Template driven forms section of the Udemy Angular course by Maximilian Schwarzm√ºller.  
The goal of this repo is the following:
1. Learn about Template driven forms
2. Practice with Template driven forms

## Challenges

The syntax for html forms will always be html. Angular provides some tools on top of this to make things easier. 

The biggest challenge is validation on the form. I'm still getting used to working with references, which are very helpful when working with validation. 

I have not worked with custom validation yet but I'm sure that will be very insightfull and provide it's own challenges.

## Things I learned

* Angulars way of submitting forms
* Angular pre-built directives for validation
* ngModel binding and usage
* Accessing form data
